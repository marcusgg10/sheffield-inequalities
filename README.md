# This study investigates the relationship between house prices, schooling outcomes and state-funded secondary school catchment boundaries in Sheffield, UK.

This repository showcases the work from a project I carried out on school inequalities with the research question: To what extent do state-funded secondary school catchment areas affect house prices, and how is this relationship influenced by educational outcomes in Sheffield?

Since this project, I have used the data to create an interactive map that visualises the average house prices in each secondary school boundaries (an average of 2022) with statitics on the percentage of pupils at each school achieving both a 4 in English and Maths at GCSE level (2024). The interactive version of this map can be accessed here: https://marcusgg10.github.io/sheffield-inequalities/ . 

# About the Interactive Map

The map has a control panel that allows you to change the metric at the top, which will change what is displayed on the map either Average House Price, Value Index or GCSE English and Maths pass rate (%). Below this metric dropdown is a table that allows you toggle individual layers on and off, especially useful due to the overlapping nature of catchment boundaries. It also allows the user to sort by ascending or descending order for each value. In the top left corner is a search metric which allows the user to search addresses and it will inform the user what catchment that address falls into (you can select multiple address to compare).
